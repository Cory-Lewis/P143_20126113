Drip... Drip... Drip...

The cool water wakes you from your slumber. Dreams of falling linger in your mind...
In the dim light you can make out most of your surroundings. 
Crumbling stone walls covered in moss stretch ahead as far as you can see.
A green glow in the distance catches your attention, you see plants growing out through cracks in the walls.
Considering the state of this place, it must have been a while since anyone has been here.
Where are you?
More importantly...
Who are you?
