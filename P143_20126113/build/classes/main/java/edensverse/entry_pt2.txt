... Yes, thinking back on it, that rings a bell.
You strain in an attempt to remember anything else. Drawing a complete blank.
Deciding it's best to move on for now, you turn back to your surroundings.
At your feet lies a sword, however, calling it a sword doesn't seem to do it justice.
The thing is about as long as you are tall! The entire blade is pitch black and about as wide as your head.
Gripping the worn leather handle, something akin to nostalgia, it feels... Right.
