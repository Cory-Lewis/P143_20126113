At your feet lies a small brown rucksack. Looking inside you find a small crystal.
It fits snugly into the palm of your hand, the jagged edges remind you of a bat's wings.
It's a deep shade of reddish-purple, with a sword etched in gold in the middle.
Mesmerized by the crystal, something comes over you. The aether around you swirls and becomes pitch black.

*System Notice*
"Your darkside stirs..."
"Class: Dark Knight"

You notice something approaching you in the distance. You are not alone.
Considering there seems to be only one exit, you have no choice but to fight.
You ready your weapon and start moving towards the unknown enemy...
